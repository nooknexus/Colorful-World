# Privacy Policy for Colorful World

**Last Updated:** October 27, 2025

Thank you for using Colorful World. This privacy policy outlines how our browser extension handles your data.

## 1. Data Collection

**Colorful World does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personally identifiable information or any data related to your browsing activity.**

The extension is designed to be completely self-contained. All its operations are performed locally on your computer.

## 2. Permissions

The extension requires the following permissions to function correctly:

*   **`storage`**: This permission is used to save the extension's current state (whether it is enabled or disabled) on your local machine. This data is not sent anywhere.
*   **`scripting`** and **`activeTab`**: These permissions are necessary to inject the CSS code that removes the grayscale filter from the websites you visit. The extension does not read or interact with the content of the pages beyond applying this style modification.

## 3. Data Usage

Since no data is collected, no data is used for any purpose. The extension's sole function is to modify the appearance of websites as instructed by you.

## 4. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy in the future. Any changes will be reflected in a new version of the extension, and the "Last Updated" date will be revised.

## 5. Contact Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to open an issue on our project's source code repository.
